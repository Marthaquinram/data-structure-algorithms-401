# Code Challenge 36

## Graph Breadth First

### Feature Tasks

1. Write the following method for the Graph class:

- breadth first
- Arguments: Node
- Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
- Display the collection

## Structure and Testing

1. Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

2. Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.

3. Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
